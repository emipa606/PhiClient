Online Multi-cities for Rimworld (v1.0)

Phi was originally created by Longwelwind, however he is no longer supporting it. As such I have picked it up and continued development. If the original creator wishes for it to be taken down, I will do so.

This mod allows you to transfer items, animals, and colonists to other people's games through the server.
It also allows you to chat with them.

[strike]NOTE: VERIFY THE SERVER YOU ARE TRYING TO CONNECT TO IS 1.0
Attempting to connect to the wrong version will not work.[/strike]

Improvements include:
Pawns now remember eachother across worlds/games.
Animals save completed training (however due to private fields, not partial training)

NOTE:
Huglibs is now required due to apparently new mutli-threaded mod loading
